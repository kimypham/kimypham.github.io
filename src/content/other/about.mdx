Hi there, I'm Kim, a frontend software developer from Melbourne, Australia. 👩‍💻

I love love love to create, and coding is another way I go about it :)

You can find the various projects I've worked on, and some ramblings and learnings from me in the blog section (coming soon!)

Besides from tech, I enjoy drawing, design, knitting and crocheting, and going outside.

Hope you enjoy your stay!
