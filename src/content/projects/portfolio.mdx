A dark theme starry pastel portfolio - the one you are on right now! :D

Built using TypeScript, CSS and Astro, inspired by Louis Escher's [Spectre theme](https://github.com/louisescher/spectre), and the [cappucin](https://catppuccin.com/) colour scheme (my current code theme atm!).

## Features

- Built on top of the existing template with custom styling, a twinkling starry background, new home page, work page and footer
- Responsive for all screen sizes
- Fully accessible
- Type-Safe
- Auto-generated sitemap
- Markdown / MDX Support
- Builds on content collections
- Search powered by [pagefind](https://pagefind.app)
- Comments for the project pages (scroll down below to see it in action!) powered by [giscus](https://giscus.app)

## Built with

- Astro
- TypeScript
- CSS
- GitHub Pages - for deployment

## Future features

In the future, I may expand this portfolio to also include a blog - keep on eye on this space!

## Learnings

This was my first time using Astro, and my first time making my own portfolio. I learnt a lot about Astro, and had a lot of fun. I hope to continue expanding on it in the future :)
