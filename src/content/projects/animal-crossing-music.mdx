Spectre is a terminal-inspired theme for Astro, built using Astro and TypeScript.

It was designed after my website as part of my annual tradition to re-design it, and I figured I might as well make a theme out of it.

## Features

- 100 / 100 Lighthouse performance
- Responsive for all screen sizes
- Fully accessible
- Type-Safe
- Auto-generated sitemap

## Lighthouse

Spectre scores 100 Points on every Lighthouse benchmark (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO):

## Speedy

Spectre uses no additional frameworks, not even Tailwind. This results in incredibly fast load and build times.

## Configurable

Spectre's unique features can all be turned on or off and even modified. If you, for example, dislike the comments, you can disable them with ease.
